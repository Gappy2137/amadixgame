Yknow, [rainbow]Scribblebox[/rainbow]!
It's the combination of [$9090FF]Scribble[/c], a fast and powerful text renderer, and [$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c], a narrative scripting tool.
<<wait>>
No?
-> Never heard of them.
Lemme open up the GitHub repos for them.
Uh, if you're ok with that?
-> Sure, go right ahead.
	Okey dokey, let me know when you come back...
	Pretty cool huh?
	Wouldn't it be great if you could put them together?
	-> Yes! How? I must know!

-> No thanks.
	Righto, I'll let you do your own research there. Would you like to quickly go through the features of Scribblebox though?
	-> Oh! Yes I would, please.
	-> Pass. I thought this was going to be something very different.
		Ah, nevermind. I hope you find what you were looking for!

Let's goooooo!

[$9090FF]Scribble[/c] and [$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] are two different libraries that can be used separately or combined together.
-> What's Chatterbox?
	[$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] handles what text to show to you and also allows the player to choose options. [$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] is based on a narrative design language called "Yarn" which has been used for lots of professional/commercial games.
	<<jump Tutorial>>
-> What's Scribble?
	[$9090FF]Scribble[/c] draws the text itself. It does [wave]animation[/wave] and [cycle,0,20,70,40]colours[/cycle] and lots of other things.
	What [$9090FF]Scribble[/c] draws is dictated by what [$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] passes to it.

The basic idea is that [$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] "drives" [$9090FF]Scribble[/c]. Whenever the player advances [$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] by selecting an option or continuing when [$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] is waiting, [$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] hands some text over to [$9090FF]Scribble[/c].
-> Uhuh...
We then use [$9090FF]Scribble[/c] to cache the text as "text elements". We do this so we can set up the autotyper to let the text elegantly fade in.
All the text caching is done in [fnt_consolas28]refresh_text_elements()[/f].
-> It sure is elegant.
[wheel]Thanks![/wheel]
Take a browse through the code. It's all commented and should be easy to follow. [$9090FF]Scribble[/c] and [$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] both have lots of documentation on GitHub so you can read up on each individual feature.
-> Hold up, could you go over that again?
	Sure, one sec...
	<<jump TheBasicIdea>>
-> Oooh I'd like to read about Scribble please.
	[$FFFF90]Chatterbox[/c] too?
	-> Yep.
	-> Nah, already know that library.
-> Hmm, not so familiar with Chatterbox... Could you point me in the right direction?
	[$FFFF90]Scribble[/c] too?
	-> Please.
	-> No thanks.
-> Cool! That's all I think. Thanks for your time.
I guess that's everything then...
Let me know what you get up to!
Bye!
-> See ya~
